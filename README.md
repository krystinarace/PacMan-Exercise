# PacMan-Exercise
Project Title: PacMan Exercise

Description of Project:  When the “add PacMan” button is clicked, a new PacMan enters the screen.  Upon clicking the “Start Game” button, the velocity of the PacMan increases.

How to Run: After loading the index.html file, click the “Add PacMan” button.  To accelerate the PacMan, click the “Start Game” button.

Roadmap of Future Improvements:  Improvements that could be made in the future would be changing color of PacMan upon click, changing velocity of PacMan when they collide with each other, and adding ghosts upon right click.
